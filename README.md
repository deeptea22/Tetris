# Tetris
## In Tetris, we try to complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces known as tetrominoes, which gravitate onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and allocate us points, and we can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled completely. The longer we can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher our score will be.
